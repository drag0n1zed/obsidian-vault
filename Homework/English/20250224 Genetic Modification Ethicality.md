Counterarguments for "Genetic modification of humans should be permitted":


GGE = Germline Genome Editing

- Genome editing will likely be used for genetic enhancement.
- Unequal access to genome editing could create a societal divide.
- This divide would be between "enhanced" individuals and the "un-enhanced"
- Genetic enhancement could create a perception of "superiority."
- This perceived "superiority" conflicts with the goal of social equality.

- Current gene editing technology is not mature enough for prevention of unintended mutations at incorrect locations in the genome.
- Incomplete editing leads to a mix of edited and unedited cells (mosaicism) can create unpredictable health risks.

- Long-term consequences of **GGE** is even more unpredictable and untraceable than somatic cell editing, especially when passed down to future generations.
- Seemingly harmless modifications could have negative effects in the future, and certain genes considered pathogenic might actually have unknown benefits (sickle-cell trait conferring malaria resistance)

Good morning everyone. Today we're discussing Genome Editing's risks. It's crucial to understand that while GE holds potential, its use for genetic enhancement raises serious concerns. 

Firstly, unequal access to genome editing could very likely create a significant societal divide, separating 'enhanced' individuals from those either not able to enhance or those not willing to. This division risks fostering a damaging perception of superiority, directly contradicting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number 10, "Reduced Inequalities", and SDG number 16, "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions".

Furthermore, current gene editing technology is simply not mature enough. We are not yet able to prevent unintended mutations at incorrect locations in the genome. Incomplete editing, leading to mosaicism, also creates unpredictable and potentially serious health risks.

Finally, the long-term consequences of Germline Genome Editing, a type of Genome Editing that alters the DNAs in sperm and egg cells, can pass down bloodlines and create problems in our body that are even more unpredictable and untraceable than somatic cell editing. Seemingly harmless modifications today could have negative effects in the future, and we must remember that genes we currently consider pathogenic might actually have unknown benefits, like the sickle-cell trait's resistance to malaria.

Therefore, we must proceed with caution and careful consideration as we explore the implications of Genome Editing, especially the Germline variant.
