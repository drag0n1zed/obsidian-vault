The traveler and his donkey were an interesting pair. The man wore a torn jacket and trousers, his face unwashed for five days; beneath the moon’s gentle, clean light, the dust hidden within the donkey’s filthy coat was highlighted.

They appeared unexpectedly in the silence of midnight. Just as I quenched the fire and was ready for bed, I heard distinct footsteps of the traveling duo. The man eagerly knocked on the door, just loud enough for me to hear, and I grumbled. *Another late arrival!* I thought. Who travels at this hour with this stubborn-looking donkey as a company? I had the urge to not answer and leave him out in the cold, but the thought of someone stranded on the streets, hungry and miserable... I relit the fire, more out of duty than kindness. He ate that bread and ham like it was his final meal.

This morning, however, presented quite a different aspect of the traveler. While I prepared a simple breakfast - with more effort put in than last night's scraps - he initiated a conversation. He spoke in a rather, *refined* accent, not at all resembling someone of his appearance.

He described his journey, a solitary trek, through chestnut shadows and mountain silence, embracing cool air beneath the day's heat and starlight with the night's chill, with only the donkey, Modestine, for companionship - a journey marked by the beauty of the landscape and the whispering music of the wind. He traveled, he explained, not for a destination, but for the spiritual experience. He started far away, mentioned Florac, and had simply followed the winding roads, sleeping in whatever comfortable "gully" he had found.

I have to admit, my initial judgement of him was quite premature: there was a poetic quality in his thoughts. Yet, I find his mission peculiar - to wander aimlessly with no goal or purpose felt like a complete waste of time. It is a life I cannot comprehend, but I suppose one find their own path, however strange it may seem to others.
